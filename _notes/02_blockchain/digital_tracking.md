# alzheimer's

- ![](../assets/26_1.png)
- overview
  - age-associated - tons of people get it
  - doesn't kill you, secondary complications like pneumonia will kill you
  - rate is going up
  - very expensive to treat
- _declarative_ memories are affected by Alzheimer's
  - these are memories that you know
- first 2 areas to go in Alzheimer's
  1.  _hippocampus_
      - patient HM had no hippocampus
        - no _anterograde_ memory - learning new things
      - hippocampus stores 1 day of info
        - offloading occurs during sleep (REM sleep) to prefrontal cortex, temporal lobe, V4
        - dreaming - might see images as you are offloading
  2.  _basal forebrain_ - spread synapses all over cortex
      - uses _Ach_
      - ignition key for entire cortex
- alzheimer's characteristics only found in autopsy
  - _amyloid plaques_
    - maybe _A-beta_ causes it
    - A-beta comes from _APP_
    - _A-beta42_ binds to itself
      - prion (starts making more of itself)
      - this cycle could be exacerbated by injury
      - clumps and attracts immune system which kills local important cells
        - this could cause Alzheimer's
      - rare genetic mutations in A-beta increase probability you get Alzheimer's
      - anti-inflammation may be too late
      - can take drugs that increase Ach functions - ex. cholinergic agonists, cholinesterase inhibitors
  - _tangles_
    - tangles made of protein called _Tau_
  - most people think these are just dead cells resulting from Alzheimer's but some think they cause it

# parkinson's

- loss of substantia nigra pars compacta dopaminergic neurons
  - when you get down to 20% what you were born with
  - dopaminergic neurons form _melanin_ = dark color
  - hits to head can give inflammation
- know what they need to do - don't have enough dopamine to act
- treat with L Dopa -> something like dopamine -> take out globus pallidus
- _Lewy bodies_ are clumps of _alpha synuclein_ - appear at dopaminergic synapses
  - clumps like A-beta42
  - associated with early-onset Parkinson's (rare) associated with genetic mutations
- _bradykinesia_ - slowness of movement
- age can give parksinson's
- no evidence that toxins can induce parkinsons
- _PTP/ pesticides_ can induce Parkinson's in test animals
- 1/500 people

# pathology

## basics

- **pathologists** work with tissue samples either visually or chemically
  - _anatomic_ pathology relies on the microscope whereas _clinical_ pathology does not
- pathologists convert from tissue image into written report
- when case is challenging, may require a second opinion (v rare)
- steps (process takes 9-12 hrs): ![tissue_prep](../assets/tissue_prep.png)
  - tissue is surgically removed
    - more tissue collected is generally better (gives more context)
    - this procedure is called a _biopsy_
    - much is written down at this step (e.g. race, gender, locations in organ, different tumors in an organ) that can't be seen in slide alone
  - fixation: keeps the tissue stable (preserves dna also) - basicallly just soak in formalin
  - dissection: remove the relevant part of the tissue
  - tissue processor - removes water in tissue and substitute with wax (parafin) - hardens it and makes it easy to cut into thin strips
  - microtone - cuts very thin slices of the tissue (2-3 microns)
  - staining
    - **H & E** - hematoxylin and eosin stain - most popular (~80%) - colors the cells in a specific way, bc cells are usually pretty transparent
      - hematoxylin stains nucleic acids blue
      - eosin stains proteins / cytoplasm pink/red
    - **immunohistochemistry (IHC)** - tries to identify cell lineage: 10-15%
      - identifies targets
      - use antibodies tagged with chromophores to tag tissues
    - gram stain - highlights bacteria
    - giemsa - microorganisms
    - others...for muscle, fungi
  - viewing
    - usually analog - put slide on something that can move / rotate
    - whole-slide image (WSI) - resulting entire slide
      - tissue microarray (TMA) - smaller, fits many samples onto the same slide
    - with paige: put slide through digital scanner (only 5% or so of slides are currently digital)
  - later on, board meets to decide on treatment (based on pathology report)
    - usually some discussion betweeon original imaging (pre-biopsy) and pathologist's interpretation
  - resection - after initial diagnosis, often entire tumor is removed (**resection**)
- how can ai help?
  - can help identify small things in large images
  - can help with conflict resolution
- after (successful) neoadjuvant chemotherapy, problem becomes more difficult
  - very few remaining cancer cells
  - cancer/non-cancer cells become harder to distinguish (esp. for prostate)
  - tumor bed is patchily filled with cancer cells - need to better clarify presence of cancer

## papers

- [Deep Learning Models for Digital Pathology](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.12329) (BenTaieb & Hamarneh, 2019)
  - note: alternative to histopathology are more expensive / slower (e.g. molecular profiling)
  - to promote consistency and objective inter-observer agreement, most pathologists are trained to follow simple algorithmic decision rules that sufficiently stratify patients into reproducible groups based on tumor type and aggressiveness
  - magnification usually given in microns per pixel
  - WSI files are much larger than other digital images (e.g. for radiology)
  - DNNs can be used for many tasks: beyond just classification, there are subtasks (e.g. count histological primitives, like nuclei) and preprocessing tasks (e.g. stain normalization)
  - challenge: multi-magnification + **high dimensions** (i.e. millions of pixels)
    - people usually extract smaller patches and train on these
      - this loses larger context
      - one soln: pyramid representation: extract patches at different magnification levels
      - one soln: stacked CNN - train fully-conv net, then remove linear layer, freeze, and train another fully-conv net on the activations (so it now has larger receptive field)
      - one soln: use 2D LSTM to aggregate patch reprs.
    - challenge: annotations only at the entire-slide level, but must figure out how to train individual patches
      - e.g. use aggregation techniques on patches - extract patch-wise features then do smth simple, like random forest
      - e.g. treat as weak labels or do multiple-instance learning
        - could just give slide-level label to all patches then vote
    - can use transfer learning from related domains with more labels
  - challenge: class imbalance
    - can use boosting approach to increase the likelihood of sampling patches that were originally incorrectly classified by the model
  - challenge: need to integrate in other info, such as genomics
  - when predicting histological primitives, often predict pixel-wise probability maps, then look for local maxima
    - can also integrated domain-knowledge features
    - can also have 2 paths, one making bounding-box proposals and another predicting the probability of a class
    - alternatively, can formulate as a regression task, where pixelwise prediction tells distance to nearest centroid of object
    - could also just directly predict the count
  - can also predict survival analysis
- [Clinical-grade computational pathology using weakly supervised deep learning on whole slide images](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-019-0508-1) (campanella et al. 2019)
  - use slide-level diagnosis as "weak supervision" for all contained patches
  - 1st step: train patch-level CNNs using MIL
    - if label is 0, then all patches should be 0
    - if label is 1, then only pass gradients to the top-k predicted patches
  - 2nd step: use RNN (or another net) to combine info across _S_ most suspicious tiles
- [Human-interpretable image features derived from densely mapped cancer pathology slides predict diverse molecular phenotypes](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-21896-9) (diao et al. 21)
- [An artificial intelligence algorithm for prostate cancer diagnosis in whole slide images of core needle biopsies: a blinded clinical validation and deployment study](<https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landig/article/PIIS2589-7500(20)30159-X/fulltext>) (pantanowitz et al. 2020 - ibex)
  - 549 train, 2501 internal test slides, 1627 external validation
  - predict cancer prob., gleason score 7-10, gleason pattern 5, perneural invasion, cancer percentage
  - algorithm
    - GB classifies background / non-background / blurry using hand-extracted features for each tile
    - each tile gets predicted probability for 18 pre-defined classes (e.g. GP 3)
      - ensemble of 3 CNNs that operate at different magnifications
    - aggregation: 18-probability heatmaps are combined to calculate slide-level scores
      - ex (for predicting cancer): sum the cancer-related channels in the heatmap , apply 2x2 local averaging, then take max

# cancer

## overview

- **tumor** = neoplasm - a mass formation from an uncontrolled growth of cells
  - benign tumor - typically stays confined to the organ where it is present and does not cause functional damage
  - malignant tumor = cancer - comprises organ function and can spread to other organs (**metastasis**)
- relation network based aggregator on patches
- lymphatic system drains fluids (non-blood) from organs into _lymph nodes_
  - cancer often mestastasize through these
- **staging** - describes where cancer is located and where it has spread
  - **clinical staging** - based on non-tissue things
  - **pathological staging** - elements of staging pTNM
    - size / depth of _tumor_ "T"
    - number of lymph _nodes_ / how many had cancer "N"
    - number of _metastatic_ foci in non-lymph node organ "M"
    - these are combined to determine the cancer stage (0-4)
- **prognosis** - chance of recovery

### treatments

- chemo
  - traditional chemotherapy disrupts cell replication
    - hair loss and gastrointestinal symptoms occur bc these cells also rapidly replicate
  - _adjuvant_ chemotherapy - after cancer is removed, most common
  - _neoadjuvant_ chemo - after biopsy, but before resection (when very hard to remove)
- targeted therapies
  - ex. address genetic aberration found in cancer cells
  - immunotherapy - enhance body's immune response to cancer cells (so body will attack these cells on its own)
    - want the antigens on the tumor to be as different as possible (so they will be characterized as foreign)
    - to measure this, can conduct total mutational burden (TMB) or miscrosatellite instability (MSI) test
      - genetic tests - hard to do by looking at glass slide
    - some tumors express receptors (e.g. CTLA4, PD1) that shut off immune cells - some drugs try to block these receptors

## prostate cancer

- tests
  - feel with finger
  - antigen test - blood test
  - ultrasound - probe inserted
  - biopsy - needle inserted to take out tissue
- grading
  - stages (they have subdivisions, e.g. IIA, IIB, IIC)
    - I - early, slow-growing
    - II - small, but risky
    - III - likely to spread
    - IV - has spread beyond the prostate
    - recurrent - has come back after treatment
  - in addition to stages 0-4, prostate cancer is also given **Gleason score**
    - look at 2 biggest cancer regions and identifies them as a **Gleason pattern** from 3 (best) to 5 (worst)
    - this results in a sum (e.g. 5+4, 3+4) - note 3+4 is not same as 4+3
- treatments
  - prostatectomy - remove the prostate
  - radiation therapy - kills specifically cancer cells
  - radiative seed implants - implated into prostate to kill cancer cells
  - cryotherapy - kill prostate cancer cells by freezing them
  - hormone therapy - block hormone which grows prostate cancer cells
  - chemotherapy
- human benchmarks

## bladder cancer

- tests
  - urinalysis - look for things like blood in urine
  - urine cytology - use microscope to look for cancer cells in urine
  - urine tests for specific tumor parkers
  - cystoscopy - invasive lens takes image of bladder
  - tests lead to a biopsy
- grading
  - invasiveness: can be non-invasive, invasive (grows into deeper layers of bladder)
    - superficial = non-muscle invasive - hasn't grown into main muscle layer of bladder
  - grade: again asigned stages 0 - IV based on TNM
    - low-grade = well-differentiated
    - high-grade (worse) = poorly differentiated, undifferentiated
- human benchmark
  - [The reliability of staging and grading of bladder tumours. Impact of misinformation on the pathologist's diagnosis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8290915/) (olsen et al. 1993)

- bladder basics

  - muscles in bladder contract and force urine out

    - _urethelium_ - inner layer that is able to stretch (has many layers) - this is where cancer originates

      - in situ - cancer only here
      - invasive - goes into the muscle
        - if it goes into the urine, can easily test (also usually triggers blood in the urine)

    - biopsy usually looks mostly at urethelium and vessels right next to it (will not go all the way to the muscle, as this could puncture the bladder)

      - very targeted (unlike prostate biopsy), slide will come with some tag like "in area with redness" from scopy
        - 4 possibilities
          - big mass - should see cancer
          - inflammation - could be cancer or many other things (e.g. atypia vs carcinoma)
      - get many parts / sites of biopsies

**H & E slide**

- shape:

| papillary                                   | flat                                          | can also have a combo |
| ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| ![pap_blad](../assets/pap_blad-5625041.png) | ![flat_blad](../assets/flat_blad-5625041.png) |                       |

- grade:

| low                                                     | high                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| ![low_grade_blad](../assets/low_grade_blad-5625041.png) | ![high_grade_blad](../assets/high_grade_blad-5625041.png) |

- when shape is flat, grade often can't be determined reliably
  - lots of names for uncertain (e.g. upump - uncertain malignant potential, or atypia)
- much easier to decide shape than grade
- once you find high grade, look for invasiveness (and deeper layers are worse)
