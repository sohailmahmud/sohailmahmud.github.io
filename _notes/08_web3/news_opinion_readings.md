  - learning how to think is about reconsidering your default believes and deciding how you see things
  - everything you experience has you at the center of it
  - everyone worships something (e.g. money, success)
    - the problem with many of these are that they are unconscious
  - One way to practice attention is to notice the non-logical aspects of communication
