# verifiably truthful mechanisms

**Simina Branzei**

- algorithms with incentives
- ingredients
  - mechanism design - a collective decision problem (e.g. allocation of EM spectrum by gov.)
  - a measure of quality
  - a description of the resources held by the participants
- ex. auction - want to allocate a painting
- ex. medical DNN might be biased to over-medicate and sell more antibiotics
- goal: design truthful mechanisms for which truthfulness can be verified efficiently
  - thruthfulness = optimal for an agent to reveal their data (e.g. say how much they value an item in an auction)
