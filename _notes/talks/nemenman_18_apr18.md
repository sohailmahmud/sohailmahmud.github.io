# playing newton - ilya nemenman, emory

- cartography story - too detailed a map would cover the whole world, not useful
- common opionion: "final theory of biological systems will be a large multiscale computational model"
- no such thing as a final theory
- "dont model bulldozers with quarks"
- what is a good theory?
  - avoiding a map on the scale of 1-1
  - falsifiable but not falsified
  - empirical philosophy of science
  - quanta magazine 2015 - a fight for the soul of science
    - theory was able to explain experiment and its inverse
  - philosophy has failed to define science - no dichotomies - grayscale of goodness of theories
- theories don't have to be correct, just have to explain missing data
  - wouldn't answer every question, but specific questions on coarse scales
  - will only answer questions about what they were fit to
- bottom-up approach might not work because too many things, would require very good model
- two types of model families
  - sigmoidal recurrent networks
  - S-systems
- automated Sir Isaac - finds hidden variable needed to account for the Newton's laws (Danields and Nemenman Nature Comm 2015, PLoS ONE 2015)
  - able to extrapolate to trajectories we haven't seen
  - system figures out how many independent variables there are
- newer work in worm
  - can find single attractor vs multiple attractors
  - model learns things that weren't been put in
