- field of study - how much you can tolerate not understanding


# jack

- always limited by theory or data
- today limited by data
  - optogenetics + mri are most important
  - simple non-naturalistic experiments (e.g. words instead of narratives) simplify experiments but lower SNR dramatically  
  - can then do in-silico experiments
  - way better use of money

# gary marcus

- could computer understand microprocessor
- cortex has no canonical cortical circuit
- why people think there's a canonical circuit
  - layers look very similar
  - hierarchical processing certainly occurs
  - suer et al's studies - apparent interchangeability of cortex (only in sensory places where basically doing spectral processing)
  - deep learning works
  - parsimony
- rebuttal
  - biology is diverse
  - deep learning doesn't learn stuff...
  - there is more diversity between cortical areas than people thought
    - motor cortex is a little different...
- cotex has set of basic circuit types (atoms of neural computation paper)
- want to build in elements that do logic opereations
- goal: find basic inventory of elements (like gates etc.)
- figure out how to combine them
- bottom-up data is unlikely to get us there
- theories work at different scales
  - 1 molecule, 2 molecule, or million molecules
