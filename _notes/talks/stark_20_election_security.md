# Evidence-Based Elections
**philip stark, uc berkeley**

- voting tech can violate people's right to vote
- arguments us elections can't be hacked - none of these are true
  - physical security
  - not connect too internet
    - paper is the only thing fully secure right now - not all paper works, but can be done well
  - tested before election day
  - too decentralized
