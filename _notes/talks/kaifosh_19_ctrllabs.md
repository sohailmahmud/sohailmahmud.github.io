# CTRL-labs: Non-Invasive Neural Interfaces for Human Augmentation
- **Patrick Kaifosh**, CTRL-labs
- neural interface can be used for browsing
- some people don't like using eye-tracking
- principles
  - human input bandwidth > human output bandwidth
  - spikes are basis of neural code - inacessible non-invasively
  - muscles amplify neural signals
    - ideas - targeted muscle reinnervation - use surface to read muscles from non-severed part
  - cortical code is distributed and complex
  - motor neural code is simple
  - spinal motor neurons are the nervous system's evolved output port
  - the hand is a major recipient of neural output
- is motor system too simple?
  - textbook: "the brain cannot selectively activate specific motor units"
  - realistically, seems like they can be learned
- how to build it?
  - wearable emg w/ dry electrodes
  - need to do spike sorting
- demo
  - very good model of hand - want to get to negative latency (ex. 50 ms lag, longer for actual motions)
  - can model grasp force, individual fingers
- applications
  - button pressing
  - typing - everything is pipelined so latency doesn't really matter...
  - don't even really need the hand...
  - might be able to reduce fatigue
  - can give auditory feedback during learning
