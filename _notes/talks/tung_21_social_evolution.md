# Genomic insights into primate evolution, behavior, and divergence

- social factors are likely 'fundamental causes' of disease
  - chetty et al 2016 (JAMA) - increased mean household income dramatically increases expected lifespan (even once you have a lot of money)
  - in male babboons, high rank predicts accelerated (biological) aging - but not females
- social factors change expression of some genes
  - ex. when introducing into a new group, earlier introduced individuals become more "dominant"
    - rhesus macaques are very hierarchical
    - final rank matters a lot for expression of some genes
    - rank in previous group vs new group (interaction) matters for gene expression
- social processes can change pop. genetic structure
