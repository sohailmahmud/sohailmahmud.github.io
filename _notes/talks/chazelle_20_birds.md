# Is life all about communication: a theoretical perspective

**Bernard Chazelle, Princeton**

- turing's world view
  - information
  - processing
  - left out communication
- order from local rules
  - statistical mechanics
  - influence systems
  - active matter
- statistical mechanics: ising model - particles want to be similar to their neighbors
  - they also fluctuate randomly based on something, like temperature
  - can get probability distr over states as Boltzmann distribution
- influence systems - multiagent systems
  - communication rules
  - state-transition rules
