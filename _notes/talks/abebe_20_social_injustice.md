# Roles for computing in social justice

**Rediet Abebe**

- situations: who gets organs, bail, etc
- solutionism - idea that computing will solve our problems, but it often introduces bias
- does computing have a role to play?
  - computing as a **diagnostic** - can help us measure social problems (and how they manifest in technical systems)
    - sweeney (2013) - racial bias in ad delivery
    - buolawamwini & gebru (2018) - facial analysis
    - gender bias in word embeddings, speech
    - ex. health info bias (abebe et al. 2019) - depending on what you search in search engine, you get very different quality of content
      - search engine backend processing (e.g. fixes typos) applies less to bad searches
      - there are way more pages on legitimate searches, so sometimes on bad searches the search engine is forced to show you a relevant but low-quality page
    - however, diagnosis is not treatment - so need to go beyond diagnosing the problem
  - **formalizer** - can helps us better quantify things like "best interestes of the child" or "hire the most qualified applicant"
    - objective functions force us make explicit specifications
  - **rebuttal** - can clarify the limits of technical interventions
    - ex. push back on "extreme vetting" automated social media scanning
  - **synecdoche** - makes long-standing social problems newly salient in the public eye
- thoughts on ml
  - we have responsibility in how our research is understood and used
    - good stuff often isn't translated to policy
    - bad stuff shouldn't be done
  - build partnerships and trust w/ domain experts
  - representation in computing matters

- **“the master’s tools will never dismantle the master’s house.”** 
- code is law

- huge imbalance in legal representation based on wealth - can we help this with tech?
- same for collecting claims (e.g. veteran's benefits)
- how to change things - cannot try what was tried before?
- lots of different meanings of what privacy is
  - the ambiguity in the word helps policy not really do anything
- are these algorithms as flawed as humans? more?
