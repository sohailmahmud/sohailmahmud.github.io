Some notes on information retrieval, based on UVA"s Info Retrieval course.

# introduction
- building blocks of search engines
    - search (user initiates)
    - reccomendations - proactive search engine (program initiates e.g. pandora, netflix)
    - information retrieval - activity of obtaining info relevant to an information need from a collection of resources
    - information overload - too much information to process
    - memex - device which stores records so it can be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility (search engine)
- IR pieces
    1. Indexed corpus (static)
        - crawler and indexer - gathers the info constantly, takes the whole internet as input and outputs some representation of the document
            - web crawler - automatic program that systematically browses web
        - document analyzer - knows which section has what
            -takes in the metadata and outputs the index (condensed), manage content to provide efficient access of web documents
    2. User
        - query parser - parses the search terms into managed system representation
    3. Ranking
        - ranking model
            -takes in the query representation and the indices, sorts according to relevance, outputs the results
        - also need nice display
        - query logs - record user's search history
        - user modeling - assess user's satisfaction
- steps ![](../assets/ir_architecture.png) 
    1. repository -> document representation 
    2. query -> query representation
    3. ranking is performed between the 2 representations and given to the user
    4. evaluation - by users
- information retrieval:
    1. reccomendation
    2. question answering
    3. text mining
    4. online advertisement

database systems        | information retrieval
- | 
structured data         | unstructured data
semantics are well-defined |  semantics are subjective
structured query languages (ex. SQL) | simple keyword queries
exact retrieval         | relevance-drive retrieval
emphasis on efficiency  | emphasis on effectiveness

- natural language processing - currently the bottleneck
    - deep understainding of language
    - cognitive approaches vs. statistical
    - small scale problems vs. large
- developing areas
    - currently mobile search is big - needs to use less data, everything needs to be more summarized
    - interactive retrieval - like a human being, should collaborate
- core concepts
    - *information need* - desire to locate and obtain info to satisfy a need
    - *query* - a designed representation of user's need
    - *document* - representation of info that could satisfy need
    - *relevance* - relatedness between documents and need, this is vague
        - multiple perspectives: topical, semantic, temporal, spatial (ex. gas stations shouldn't be behind you)
- Yahoo used to have system where you browsed based on structure (browsing), but didn't have queries (querying)
    - better when user doesn't know keywords, just wants to explore
    - push mode - systems push relevant info to users without a query
    - pull mode - users pull out info using keywords
