- isolated tress have far shorter lives than those living connected together in forests
- fungal networks around the root tips--which facilitate nutrient exchange between trees--or the roos themselves may be interconnected
- on its own, a tree cannot establish a consistent local climate
- as a rule, trees in planted forests like these behave like loners and suffer from their isolation
- acacia trees that were being eaten gave off a warning gas (specifically ethylene) that signaled to neighboring trees of the same species of a crisis
- trees can match the saliva to the insect. Indeed, the match can be so precise that trees can release pheromones that summon specific beneficial predators
- they also warn each other using chemical signals sent through the fungal networks
- via the roots not only by means of chemical compounds but also by means of electrical impulses
- "wood wide web"
- beech forest is more productive when the trees are packed together
  - when trees grow together, nutrients and water can be optimally divided among them all so that each tree can grow into the best tree it can be
- trees in a forest prefer to bloom at the same time so that the genes of many individual trees can be well mixed
  - and that's why the trees agree in advance. If they don't bloom every year, then the herbivores canno count on them
  - how inbreeding can be avoided in such chaotic conditions
  - male and female blossoms open a few days apart so that, most of the time, the latter will be dusted with the foreign pollen of other spruce
  - there are both male and female willows
- growing
  - many other species give their seeds the opportunity to wait 1 or more years until they start to grow
  - if a tree is obviously wider than it is tall, then it is in waiting mode
