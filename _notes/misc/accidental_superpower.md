# 1. the world we think we know
- 1944 - birth of world bank, IMF, international bank for reconstruction and development

# 2. egypt - the art of getting from here to there
- rivers are basically everything
	- even today it is much harder to transport without a river
- civilizations want easy transportation within the civ. but strong borders
	- egypt had this to the extreme
		- they become very isolated
		- they had slavery
		- they didn't have much technological innovation and were conquered

# 3. technological revolutions - deepwater navigation and industrialization
- next important is *deepwater navigation* - technologies like the compass
- finally is *industrialization* - germany gained very much from this

# 4. enter the accidental superpower
- America has drmatically more rivers than the rest of the world combined
	- also has barrier islands that make the coast navigable
	- has more port access than anywhere else
- has no serious threats to military
	- insulated
	
# 5. buying off geopolitics
- after WWII everyone was destroyed except US
- many were expecting a Pax Americana at *Bretton Woods* conference
	- America is not well-positioned for occupation
	- maritime forces are better at fighting and leaving
- instead *Bretton Woods* offers essentially a bribe
	1. access to the American market
	2. protection for all shipping
	3. strategic umbrella - other countries agree to support US against iron curtain
- needed China to get on board
	- China was facing tensions with Soviet Union
	- China US relations were bad
	- 1971 ping-pong world championships US player mistakenly gets on Chinese Bus
		- they exchange gifts and get famous
		- China invites US to play some exhibition matches
		- follows into real politics
- this system made sense for US during cold war, but no longer makes sense
	- America will likely soon stop paying for this
	
# 6 - demographic roller coaster (unclear)
- population pyramids should be wider at bottom
	- after baby boomers too many at top
- people in 40s-50s provide most capital to countries
	- this is important for economy
	- they invest their money
- old people are biggest drain on system (draw pensions, withdraw money from investments)
- children are also big burden on system
- young people (20-40) drive consumer growth

# 7 - rise of shale
- fracking
	- most petroleum was in wells but most is in porous rocks called shale
	1. horizontal drilling - allows for bypassing things
	2. hydraulic fracturing - uses water pressure to crack rock
- this helps the US more than anyone else
	1. requires huge, deep capital markets
	2. highly skilled labor
	3. legal structure that rewards landowners for their participation
	4. preexisting natural gas collection, transport, and distribution infrastructure
- US benefits
	- jobs
	- decreased emmissions
	- lower prices
	- less foreign dependence
- 3-D printers can revolutionize with cheap electricity

# 8- coming international disorder
- US remains relatively unaffected when Bretton woods goes out

- major problems facing the US
	1. cartels from Mexico becoming established in the US
	2. climate change
	3. nuclear prliferation

- Germany must remain aggressive
- Russia state failure is imminent
- China cannot survive in the long-term
