- cognitive maps (tolman 1940s) - idea that rats in mazes learn spatial maps
- **place cells** (o'keefe 1971) - in the hippocampus - fire to indicate one's current location
- remap to new locations
- **grid cells** (moser & moser 2005) - in the entorhinal cotex (provides inputs to the hippocampus) - not particular locations but rather hexagonal coordinate system
- grid cells fire if the mouse is in any location at the vertex (or center) of one of the hexagons

# high-dimensional computing

- high-level overview
  - current inspiration has all come from single neurons at a time - hd computing is going past this
  - the brain's circuits are high-dimensional
  - elements are stochastic not deterministic
  - can learn from experience
  - no 2 brains are alike yet they exhibit the same behavior
- basic question of comp neuro: what kind of computing can explain behavior produced by spike trains?
  - recognizing ppl by how they look, sound, or behave
  - learning from examples
  - remembering things going back to childhood
  - communicating with language
- [HD computing overview paper](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s12559-009-9009-8.pdf)
  - in these high dimensions, most points are close to equidistant from one another (L1 distance), and are approximately orthogonal (dot product is 0)
  - memory
    - *heteroassociative* - can return stored *X* based on its address *A*
    - *autoassociative* - can return stored *X* based on a noisy version of *X* (since it is a point attractor), maybe with some iteration
      - this adds robustness to the memory
      - this also removes the need for addresses altogether

## definitions

- what is hd computing?
  - compute with random high-dim vectors
  - ex. 10k vectors A, B of +1/-1 (also extends to real / complex vectors)
- 3 operations
  - **addition**: A + B = (0, 0, 2, 0, 2,-2, 0,  ....)
  - **multiplication**: A * B =  (-1, -1, -1, 1, 1, -1, 1, ...) - this is **XOR**
    - want this to be invertible, dsitribute over addition, preserve distance, and be dissimilar to the vectors being multiplied
    - number of ones after multiplication is the distance between the two original vectors
    - can represent a dissimilar set vector by using multiplication
  - permutation: shuffles values
    - ex. rotate (bit shift with wrapping around)
    - multiply by rotation matrix (where each row and col contain exactly one 1)
    - can think of permutation as a list of numbers 1, 2, ..., n in permuted order
    - many properties similar to multiplication
    - random permutation randomizes
- basic operations
  - weighting by a scalar
  - similarity = dot product (sometimes normalized)
    - A $\cdot$ A = 10k
    - A $\cdot$ A = 0 (orthogonal)
    - in high-dim spaces, almost all pairs of vectors are dissimilar A $\cdot$ B = 0
    - goal: similar meanings should have large similarity
  - normalization
    - for binary vectors, just take the sign
    - for non-binary vectors, scalar weight
- data structures
- these operations allow for encoding all normal data structures: sets, sequences, lists, databases
  - set - can represent with a sum (since the sum is similar to all the vectors)
    - can find a stored set using any element
    - if we don't store the sum, can probe with the sum and keep subtracting the vectors we find
  - multiset = bag (stores set with frequency counts) - can store things with order by adding them multiple times, but hard to actually retrieve frequencies
  - sequence - could have each element be an address pointing to the next element
    - problem - hard to represent sequences that share a subsequence (could have pointers which skip over the subsquence)
    - soln: index elements based on permuted sums
      - can look up an element based on previous element or previous string of elements
    - could do some kind of weighting also
  - pairs - could just multiply (XOR), but then get some weird things, e.g. A * A = **0**
    - instead, permute then multiply
    - can use these to index (address, value) pairs and make more complex data structures
  - named tuples - have smth like (name: x, date: m, age: y)  and store as holistic vector $H = N*X + D *  M + A * Y$
    - individual attribute value can be retrieved using vector for individual key
  - representation substituting is a little trickier....
    - we blur what is a value and whit is a variable
    - can do this for a pair or for a named tuple with new values
      - this doesn't always work
- examples
  - context vectors
    - standard practice (e.g. LSA): make matrix of word counts, where each row is a word, and each column is a document
    - HD computing alternative: each row is a word, but each document is assigned a few ~10 columns at random
      - thus, the number of columns doesn't scale with the number of documents
      - **can also do this randomness for the rows (so the number of rows < the number of words)**
      - can still get semantic vector for a row/column by adding together the rows/columns which are activated by that row/column
      - this examples still only uses bag-of-words (but can be extended to more)
  - learning rules by example
    - particular instance of a rule is a rule (e.g mother-son-baby $\to$ grandmother)
      - as we get more examples and average them, the rule gets better
      - doesn't always work (especially when things collapse to identity rule)
  - analogies from pairs
    - ex. what is the dollar of mexico?

## ex. identify the language

- paper: [LANGUAGE RECOGNITION USING RANDOM INDEXING](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.7026.pdf) (joshi et al. 2015)
- benefits - very simple and scalable - only go through data once
  - equally easy to use 4-grams vs. 5-grams
- data
  - train: given million bytes of text per language (in the same alphabet)
  - test: new sentences for each language
- training: compute a 10k profile vector for each language and for each test sentence
  - could encode each letter wih a seed vector which is 10k
  - instead encode trigrams with **rotate and multiply**
    - 1st letter vec rotated by 2 * 2nd letter vec rotated by 1 * 3rd letter vec
    - ex. THE = r(r(T)) * r(H) * r(E)
    - approximately orthogonal to all the letter vectors and all the other possible trigram vectors...
  - profile = sum of all trigram vectors (taken sliding)
    - ex. banana = ban + ana + nan + ana
    - profile is like a histogram of trigrams
- testing
  - compare each test sentence to profiles via dot product
  - clusters similar languages - cool!
  - gets 97% test acc
  - can query the letter most likely to follor "TH"
    - form query vector $Q = r(r(T)) * r(H)$
    - query by using multiply X + Q * english-profile-vec
    - find closest letter vecs to X - yields "e"

## details

- mathematical background
  - randomly chosen vecs are dissimilar
  - sum vector is similar to its argument vectors
  - product vector and permuted vector are dissimilar to their argument vectors
  - multiplication distibutes over addition
  - permutation distributes over both additions and multiplication
  - multiplication and permutations are invertible
  - addition is approximately invertible
- comparison to DNNs
  - both do statistical learning from data
  - data can be noisy
  - both use high-dim vecs although DNNs get bad with him dims (e.g. 100k)
  - HD is founded on rich mathematical theory
  - new codewords are made from existing ones
  - HD memory is a separate func
  - HD algos are transparent, incremental (on-line), scalable
  - somewhat closer to the brain...cerebellum anatomy seems to be match HD
  - HD: holistic (distributed repr.) is robust

  - ross gayler: multiply-add-permute arch
  - gayler & levi: vector-symbolic arch
  - gallant & okaywe: matrix binding with additive termps
  - fourier holographic reduced reprsentations (FHRR; Plate)
  - ...many more names

- Neural Statistician (Edwards & Storkey, 2016) summarises a dataset by averaging over their embeddings
- [kanerva machine](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.01756.pdf)
  - like a VAE where the prior is derived from an adaptive memory store

  - can figure out what parts of the input the model focuses on



# dynamic routing between capsules

- hinton 1981 - reference frames require structured representations
  - mapping units vote for different orientations, sizes, positions based on basic units
  - mapping units **gate the activity** from other types of units - weight is dependent on if mapping is activated
  - top-down activations give info back to mapping units
  - this is a hopfield net with three-way connections (between input units, output units, mapping units)
  - reference frame is a key part of how we see - need to vote for transformations
- olshausen, anderson, & van essen 1993 - dynamic routing circuits
  - ran simulations of such things (hinton said it was hard to get simulations to work)
  - learn things in object-based reference frames
  - inputs -> outputs has weight matrix gated by control
- zeiler & fergus 2013 - visualizing things at intermediate layers - deconv (by dynamic routing)
  - save indexes of max pooling (these would be the control neurons)
  - when you do deconv, assign max value to these indexes
- arathom 02 - map-seeking circuits
- tenenbaum & freeman 2000 - bilinear models
  - trying to separate content + style
- hinton et al 2011 - transforming autoencoders - trained neural net to learn to shift imge
- sabour et al 2017 - dynamic routing between capsules
  - units output a vector (represents info about reference frame)
  - matrix transforms reference frames between units
  - recurrent control units settle on some transformation to identify reference frame
- notes from this [blog post](https://towardsdatascience.com/capsule-neural-networks-part-2-what-is-a-capsule-846d5418929f)
  - problems with cnns
    - pooling loses info
    - don't account for spatial relations between image parts
    - can't transfer info to new viewpoints
  - **capsule** - vector specifying the features of an object (e.g. position, size, orientation, hue texture) and its likelihood
    - ex. an "eye" capsule could specify the probability it exists, its position, and its size
    - magnitude (i.e. length) of vector represents probability it exists (e.g. there is an eye)
    - direction of vector represents the instantiation parameters (e.g. position, size)
  - hierarchy
    - capsules in later layers are functions of the capsules in lower layers, and since capsule has extra properties can ask questions like "are both eyes similarly sized?"
      - equivariance = we can ensure our net is invariant to viewpoints by checking for all similar rotations/transformations in the same amount/direction
    - active capsules at one level make predictions for the instantiation parameters of higher-level capsules
      - when multiple predictions agree, a higher-level capsule is activated
  - steps in a capsule (e.g. one that recognizes faces)
    - receives an input vector (e.g. representing eye)
    - apply affine transformation - encodes spatial relationships (e.g. between eye and where the face should be)
    - applying weighted sum by the C weights, learned by the routing algorithm
      - these weights are learned to group similar outputs to make higher-level capsules
    - vectors are squashed so their magnitudes are between 0 and 1
    - outputs a vector

# hierarchical temporal memory (htm)

- binary synapses and learns by modeling the growth of new synapses and the decay of unused synapses
- separate aspects of brains and neurons that are essential for intelligence from those that depend on brain implementation

## necortical structure

- evolution leads to physical/logical hierarchy of brain regions
- neocortex is like a flat sheet
- neocortex regions are similar and do similar computation
  - Mountcastle 1978: vision regions are vision becase they receive visual input
  - number of regions / connectivity seems to be genetic
- before necortex, brain regions were homogenous: spinal cord, brain stem, basal ganglia, ...
- ![cortical_columns](../assets/cortical_columns.png)

## principles

- common algorithims accross neocortex
- hierarchy
- **sparse distributed representations (SDR)** - vectors with thousands of bits, mostly 0s
  - bits of representation encode semantic properties
- inputs
  - data from the sense
  - copy of the motor commands
    - "sensory-motor" integration - perception is stable while the eyes move
- patterns are constantly changing
- necortex tries to control old brain regions which control muscles
- **learning**: region accepts stream of sensory data + motor commands
  - learns of changes in inputs
  - ouputs motor commands
  - only knows how its output changes its input
  - must learn how to control behavior via *associative linking*
- sensory encoders - takes input and turnes it into an SDR
  - engineered systems can use non-human senses
- behavior needs to be incorporated fully
- temporal memory - is a memory of sequences
  - everything the neocortex does is based on memory and recall of sequences of patterns
- on-line learning
  - prediction is compared to what actually happens and forms the basis of learning
  - minimize the error of predictions


## papers

- "A Theory of How Columns in the Neocortex Enable Learning the Structure of the World"
  - network model that learns the structure of objects through movement
  - object recognition
    - over time individual columns integrate changing inputs to recognize complete objects
    - through existing lateral connections
  - within each column, neocortex is calculating a location representation
    - locations relative to each other = **allocentric**
  - much more motion involved
  - multiple columns - integrate spatial inputs - make things fast
  - single column - integrate touches over time - represent objects properly
- "Why Neurons Have Thousands of Synapses, A Theory of Sequence Memory in Neocortex"
  - learning and recalling sequences of patterns
  - neuron with lots of synapses can learn transitions of patterns
  - network of these can form robust memory

# forgetting
- [Continual Lifelong Learning with Neural Networks: A Review](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.07569.pdf)
  - main issues is *catastrophic forgetting* / *stability-plasticity dilemma*
  - ![Screen Shot 2020-01-01 at 11.49.32 AM](../assets/forgetting.png)
  - 2 types of plasticity
    - Hebbian plasticity (Hebb 1949) for positive feedback instability
    - compensatory homeostatic plasticity which stabilizes neural activity
  - approaches: regularization, dynamic architectures (e.g. add more nodes after each task), memory replay

  - use kernel regression from CNN embedding to calculate distances between preset images
  - select preset images
  - verified with macaque v4 recording
  - currently only study that optimizes firing rates of multiple neurons
	- pick next stimulus in closed-loop ("adaptive sampling" = "optimal experimental design")
- J. Benda, T. Gollisch, C. K. Machens, and A. V. Herz, “From response to stimulus: adaptive sampling in sensory physiology”
  - find the smallest number of stimuli needed to fit parameters of a model that predicts the recorded neuron’s activity from the
    stimulus

  - maximizing firing rates via genetic algorithms

  - maximizing firing rate via gradient ascent
- C. DiMattina and K. Zhang,“Adaptive stimulus optimization for sensory systems neuroscience"](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2013.00101/full)

  - 2 general approaches: gradient-based approaches + genetic algorithms
  - can put constraints on stimulus space
  - stimulus adaptation
  - might want iso-response surfaces
  - maximally informative stimulus ensembles (Machens, 2002)
  - model-fitting: pick to maximize info-gain w/ model params
  - using fixed stimulus sets like white noise may be deeply problematic for efforts to identify non-linear hierarchical network models due to continuous parameter confounding (DiMattina and Zhang, 2010) 
  - use for model selection


# population coding

- saxena_19_pop_cunningham: "Towards the neural population doctrine"
  - correlated trial-to-trial variability
    - Ni et al. showed that the correlated variability in V4 neurons during attention and learning — processes that have inherently different timescales — robustly decreases
    - ‘choice’ decoder built on neural activity in the first PC performs as well as one built on the full dataset, suggesting that the relationship of neural variability to behavior lies in a relatively small subspace of the state space.
  - decoding
    - more neurons only helps if neuron doesn't lie in span of previous neurons
  - encoding
    - can train dnn goal-driven or train dnn on the neural responses directly
  - testing
    - important to be able to test population structure directly
- *population vector coding* - ex. neurons coded for direction sum to get final direction
- reduces uncertainty
- *correlation coding* - correlations betweeen spikes carries extra info
- *independent-spike coding* - each spike is independent of other spikes within the spike train
- *position coding* - want to represent a position
  - for grid cells, very efficient
- *sparse coding*
- hard when noise between neurons is correlated
- measures of information
- eda
  - plot neuron responses
  - calc neuron covariances
