- **Backward Induction** – start at the ends and consider the last moves for each player until the beginning is reached
- **Dominating strategy** – always gives a better payoff regardless of other player
	- Weakly dominating strategy – always at least as good
- **Mixed strategy** – active randomization with given probabilities that determines players decision
- **Nash equilibrium** - no player can unilaterally (without the other player changing) change his strategy and get a better payoff
- Prisoner’s Dilllema has dominant strategy of both complying
	- in a repeated game, this inefficiency can be fixed
- Quality choice game – provider and buyer can each offer high or low bandwidth
	- Two Nash equilibria
	- In an evolutionary game, which equilibrium is picked is based on what percentage of each the provider expects
	- Over time, the buyer will mimic whatever the provider is providing
- Mixed strategies – compliance inspections
	- The percentage of the time that the inspector should inspect is based on the incentive / penalty that the buyer will cheat
	- It has a mixed equilibrium, based on probabilities
	- Player’s willingness for risk and other factors are considered when determining numbers for utility
- Many games have first-mover advantage: such as firms determining how much of a product to produce
- There are games with imperfect information- ex. Deciding whether to announce or cede
- Bidding in auctions – one of the main uses of game theory
	- You should bid how much you are willing to pay
	- Winner’s curse – if you win an auction for something with common value, you probably overvalued it
